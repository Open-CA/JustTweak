JustTweak is a framework for feature flagging and A/B testing for iOS apps.
It provides a simple facade interface interacting with multiple providers that are queried respecting a given priority.
Tweaks represent flags used to drive decisions in the client code. 

With JustTweak you can achieve the following:

- use a JSON local configuration providing default values for experimentation 
- use a number of remote configuration providers such as Firebase and Optmizely to run A/B tests and feature flagging   
- enable, disable, and customize features locally at runtime
- provide a dedicated UI for customization (this comes particularly handy for feature that are under development to showcase it to stakeholders)


## Installation

JustTweak is available through [CocoaPods](http://cocoapods.org). To install it, simply add the following line to your Podfile:

```ruby
pod "JustTweak"
```

## Implementation

### Integration

- define a JSON configuration file including your features (you can use the included `ExampleConfiguration.json` as a template)
- define your features and A/B tests in your services such as Firebase and Optmizely (optional)
- configure the JustTweak stack as following

```swift
static let tweakManager: TweakManager = {
    // mutable configuration (to override tweaks from other configurations)
    let userDefaultsConfiguration = UserDefaultsConfiguration(userDefaults: UserDefaults.standard)

    // remote configurations (optional)
    let optimizelyConfiguration = OptimizelyConfiguration()
    optimizelyConfiguration.userId = <#user_id#>
    let firebaseConfiguration = FirebaseConfiguration()

    // local JSON configuration (default tweaks)
    let jsonFileURL = Bundle.main.url(forResource: "ExampleConfiguration", withExtension: "json")!
    let localConfiguration = LocalConfiguration(jsonURL: jsonFileURL)!

    // priority is defined by the order in the configurations array (from highest to lowest)
    let configurations: [Configuration] = [userDefaultsConfiguration,
                                           optimizelyConfiguration,
                                           firebaseConfiguration,
                                           localConfiguration]
    return TweakManager(configurations: configurations)
}()
```

The order of the objects in the `configurations` array defines the priority of the configurations.

The `MutableConfiguration` with the highest priority, such as `UserDefaultsConfiguration` in the example above, will be used to reflect the changes made in the UI (`TweakViewController`). The `LocalConfiguration` should have the lowest priority as it provides the default values from a local configuration and it's the one used by the `TweaksConfigurationViewController` to populate the UI.


### Usage

The three main features of JustTweak can be accessed from the `TweakManager` instance to drive code path decisions.

1. Checking if a feature is enabled

```swift
// check for a feature to be enabled
let enabled = tweakManager.isFeatureEnabled("some_feature")
if enabled {
    // enable the feature
} else {
    // default behaviour
}
```

2. Get the value of a flag for a given feature. `TweakManager` will return the value from the configuration with the highest priority and automatically fallback to the others if no set value is found.

Use either `tweakWith(feature:variable:)` or the provided property wrappers.

```swift
// check for a tweak value
let tweak = tweakManager.tweakWith(feature: "some_feature", variable: "some_flag")
if let tweak = tweak {
    // tweak was found in some configuration, use tweak.value
} else {
    // tweak was not found in any configuration
}
```

`@TweakProperty` and `@OptionalTweakProperty` property wrappers are available to mark properties representing feature flags. Mind that by using these property wrappers, a static instance of `TweakManager` is needed. 

```
@TweakProperty(fallbackValue: <#fallback_value#>,
               feature: <#feature_key#>,
               variable: <#variable_key#>,
               tweakManager: <#TweakManager#>)
var labelText: String
```

```
@OptionalTweakProperty(fallbackValue: <#nillable_fallback_value#>,
                       feature: <#feature_key#>,
                       variable: <#variable_key#>,
                       tweakManager: <#TweakManager#>)
var meaningOfLife: Int?
```

3. Run an A/B test

```swift
// check for a tweak value
let variation = tweakManager.activeVariation(for: "some_experiment")
if let variation = variation {
    // act according to the kind of variation (e.g. "control", "variation_1")
} else {
    // default behaviour
}
```


### Caching

The `TweakManager` provides the option to cache the tweak values in order to improve performance. Caching is disabled by default but can be enabled via the `useCache` property. When enabled, there are two ways to reset the cache:

- call the `resetCache` method on the  `TweakManager`
- post a `TweaksConfigurationDidChangeNotification` notification


### Update a configuration at runtime

JustTweak comes with a ViewController that allows the user to edit the `MutableConfiguration` with the highest priority.

```swift
func presentTweakViewController() {
    let tweakViewController = TweakViewController(style: .grouped, tweakManager: <#TweakManager#>)

    // either present it modally
    let tweaksNavigationController =     UINavigationController(rootViewController:tweakViewController)
    tweaksNavigationController.navigationBar.prefersLargeTitles = true
    present(tweaksNavigationController, animated: true, completion: nil)

    // or push it on an existing UINavigationController
    navigationController?.pushViewController(tweakViewController, animated: true)
}
```

When a value is modified in any `MutableConfiguration`, a notification is fired to give the clients the opportunity to react and reflect changes in the UI.

```swift
override func viewDidLoad() {
    super.viewDidLoad()
    NotificationCenter.defaultCenter().addObserver(self,
                                                   selector: #selector(updateUI),
                                                   name: TweaksConfigurationDidChangeNotification,
                                                   object: nil)
}

@objc func updateUI() {
    // update the UI accordingly
}
```


### Customization

JustTweak comes with three configurations out-of-the-box:

- `UserDefaultsConfiguration` which is mutable and uses `UserDefaults` as a key/value store 
- `LocalConfiguration` which is read-only and uses a JSON configuration file that is meant to be the default configuration
- `EphemeralConfiguration` which is simply an instance of `NSMutableDictionary`

In addition, JustTweak defines `Configuration` and `MutableConfiguration` protocols you can implement to create your own configurations to fit your needs. In the example project you can find a few example configurations which you can use as a starting point.
